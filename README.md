## Graph-Theory-Project
 
This is my Jupyter notebook for my Graph Theory Project on Graph Isomorphism.

In this project I discuss the Graph Isomorphism Problem using code and text. 
There are multiple plots showing both isomorphic and non isomorphic graphs as well as text explaining how you can find out if two given graphs are isomorphic or not.
I have also researched the computational complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.
